Proposal Summary:

**Background**: The Pacific Northwest is a geographic spectacle. Surrounded by mountains, lakes, rivers, and forests, a look in any direction is awe-inspiring. However, from being in the heart of these natural gems, Seattle residents also have to deal with rain as almost a daily norm for over half the year. Moreover, a common question asked by Seattle newcomers is "Why is the weather so bipolar here?". Indeed, this is the price that most residents pay. We may dress for a sunny day but will quickly regret this when it suddenly begins to rain in the matter of minutes. Even long-time residents have find it difficult to predict the weather as the skies look deceivingly bright.
